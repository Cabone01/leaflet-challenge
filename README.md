# Eathquake Visualization
[Website Link](https://cabone01.github.io/leaflet-challenge/)   
In this repo, a website with the link above was made to show the locations of earthquakes in the world. The data was taken from USGS GeoJSON Feed which updates frequently. The data shows the locations of the earthquake using markers. The marker's color is affected by the depth of the earthquake while its size is determined by its magnitude. Different map layouts are given in and a choice to remove the earthquake marks is given on the website.
